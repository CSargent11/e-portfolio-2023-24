	<p><b>Unit 1: History of Network Security, Vulnerabilities and Approaches</b>
		</br>
	<i>Welcome to Week 1.</i>
	This week we will review the history of network security and vulnerabilities and relate it to the modern landscape.
	We will also discuss some security best practices and review the Cyber Kill Chain model proposed by Lockheed Martin (Hutchins et al, 2011),
	which was based on a study of contemporary breach approaches.</br>
	</br>
	<i>In this unit we shall:</i></br>
	</br>
	Review the history of network security and vulnerabilities.</br>
	Discuss a best practice approach to security.</br>
	Review a number of modern scanning and attack approaches.</br>
	</br>
	<i>On completion of this unit you will be able to</i>:</br>
	</br>
	Explain the origins of a number of common attacks.</br>
	Recommend a best practice approach to mitigate attacks.</br>
	Discuss a number of modern protection techniques.</br>
	</br>
	Reflecting on this unit's activities has provided a comprehensive understanding of network security and vulnerabilities.
	Reviewing the history of network security highlighted the evolution of threats and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks.</br>
	This historical perspective is crucial for recognising patterns and origins of common attacks, such as phishing, DDoS, and SQL injection, and understanding their development over time (Sharma, 2012).
	The unit also emphasised a best practice approach to security, underlining the importance of proactive measures such as regular updates, strong authentication mechanisms, and continuous monitoring (Andress, 2019).</br>
	</br>
	Modern scanning and attack approaches, such as automated vulnerability scanners and advanced persistent threats (APTs), were explored, showcasing the ongoing arms race between attackers and defenders.
	This knowledge equips us with the ability to recommend best practices for mitigating attacks, like implementing layered security defences and fostering a culture of security awareness (Johnson, 2020).</br>
	Additionally, the discussion on modern protection techniques, such as machine learning for anomaly detection and zero-trust architecture, illustrates the innovative strategies being adopted to combat contemporary threats (Sharma, 2018).</br>
	</br>
	Overall, the insights gained from this unit enable a well-rounded approach to network security, combining historical context, best practices, and cutting-edge techniques to effectively protect against evolving cyber threats.</br>

	<b>Reflecting on the literature search and audit conducted on software sites and the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD),
	several issues and challenges were encountered within the https://ginandjuice.shop website.</b></br>
	</br>
	<i>Issues and Challenges:</i></br>
	</br>
	One significant challenge was the vast amount of data available in the NVD.
	Filtering relevant information from an extensive database required careful keyword selection and attention to detail.</br>
	Additionally, keeping track of the continuously updated data posed a challenge, as new vulnerabilities are frequently added.
	The sheer volume of vulnerabilities, especially for widely used platforms like WordPress, necessitated a focused approach to prioritize the most critical ones.</br>
	Another issue was the technical complexity of some vulnerability descriptions.
	Understanding the technical specifics of certain vulnerabilities required a deep understanding of cybersecurity concepts, which can be challenging for those not specialised in this field.</br>
	This complexity sometimes made it difficult to translate technical details into actionable insights for the audit report.</br>
	</br>
	<i>Overcoming Challenges:</i></br>
	</br>
	To overcome these challenges, a systematic approach was adopted.
	Filtering techniques were used to narrow down the search results in the NVD, focusing on vulnerabilities specific to the technologies used by the target website, such as web server software and content management systems.</br>
	Additionally, leveraging summaries and impact metrics provided by the NVD helped in prioritising vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.</br>
	Consulting additional sources such as vendor-specific security advisories and industry reports helped in cross-referencing data and gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the vulnerabilities.</br>
	This multi-source approach ensured that the audit was thorough and well-informed.</br>
	</br>
	<i>Impact on the Final Report</i></br>
	These challenges and the methods used to address them will have a positive impact on the final report.
	The systematic filtering and prioritisation of vulnerabilities will ensure that the report is focused on the most relevant and critical issues.</br>
	The inclusion of cross-referenced data from multiple sources will enhance the credibility and comprehensiveness of the findings.
	Additionally, the process of translating technical details into actionable insights will make the report more accessible to a broader audience, including stakeholders who may not have a technical background.</br>
	</br>
	In summary, despite the challenges faced during the literature search and audit, the strategies employed to overcome them have ensured that the final report will be well-organised, thorough, and actionable.
	This will ultimately contribute to a stronger security posture for the website under review.</br>

	<i>Reflection on Scanning Activity</i></br>
	1. Did you have any issues or challenges with the scans?</br>
	Yes, several issues were encountered during the scanning activity:</br>
	Traceroute Incompletion: The `traceroute` command did not complete successfully and many steps returned no response.</br>
	nslookup Command Issue: The initial attempt to run `nslookup` failed due to a syntax error.</br>
	Permission Errors: There were errors related to permissions, specifically when attempting to access certain directories.</br>
	</br>
	2. How did you overcome them?</br>
	Traceroute Incompletion: Although the `traceroute` command did not complete all hops, it still provided partial data which could be used for analysis up to the last responsive hop.</br>
	nslookup Command Issue: Re-running the `nslookup` command correctly without the erroneous pattern fixed the issue.</br>
	Permission Errors: By avoiding operations that required directory access permissions, and focusing on commands that do not have such dependencies, further progress was made.</br>
	</br>
	3. How will they affect your final report?</br>
	The issues encountered will affect the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the final report in the following ways:</br>
	Incomplete Traceroute Data: The final report will not have a complete hop count or full path analysis, which limits the insight into network delays and routing paths.</br>
	Partial Information: The final report may lack some detailed information that could have been obtained if all commands ran flawlessly.</br>
	Adapted Recommendations: The recommendations in the report will need to include suggestions for addressing the challenges encountered, such as using alternative tools or ensuring correct command usage.</br>
	</br>
	<i>Final Report</i></br>
	</br>
	Traceroute Analysis</br>
	Number of Hops**: The traceroute to `ginandjuice.shop` identified up to 6 hops before responses stopped.</br>
	Biggest Delay: The biggest delay observed was on the fourth hop, `31.55.185.176`, with a maximum delay of 36.379 ms.</br>

<b>Case Study: Reviewing an Assessment Reporting Template</b></br>
</br>
<i>Assessment Review of PurpleSec Vulnerability Scan Report</i></br>
</br>
<i>Alignment with NCSC Requirements</i></br>
Does this template meet the NCSC stated requirement of preparing a baseline to use as a reference point for pen tests?</br>
The PurpleSec vulnerability scan report partially meets the NCSC's requirement for establishing a baseline for penetration testing.
	It provides detailed information on vulnerabilities present in the client's systems, which is essential for identifying security weaknesses and understanding the current security posture.</br>
	However, to fully align with NCSC guidelines, a few improvements and additions are necessary:</br>
</br>
1. Baseline Metrics:</br>
• The report should include explicit baseline metrics for key security controls, such as patch management effectiveness, configuration management, and the overall number of vulnerabilities per host.</br>
• Incorporate historical data or trends to show progress or regression in security posture over time.</br>
</br>
2. Contextual Information:</br>
• Add more context about the environment being assessed, such as critical assets, business impact, and risk tolerance levels, to make the baseline more meaningful.</br>
• Include detailed descriptions of the environment's architecture and any relevant security policies or frameworks in place.</br>
</br>
3. Recommendations:</br>
• Enhance the recommendations section to include prioritised action items based on business impact and risk levels, as well as specific timelines for remediation.</br>
</br>
<i>Recommended Changes/Amendments:</i></br>
• Historical Data and Trends: Include graphs and tables showing historical vulnerability data and trends over time to provide a clearer baseline.</br>
• Contextual Business Impact: Add a section detailing the business impact of the vulnerabilities and the criticality of the affected systems.</br>
• Action Plan: Develop a more detailed action plan with timelines, responsible parties, and milestones to track progress.</br>
• Assessment Framework: Reference relevant security frameworks (e.g., NIST, CIS Controls) to contextualise findings within industry best practices.</br>
</br>
<i>Best Lessons/Examples</i></br>
What are the two best lessons/examples presented in the report?</br>
</br>
1. Detailed Vulnerability Breakdown:</br>
• The report provides a detailed breakdown of vulnerabilities by severity (critical, high, medium, low).
	This granular approach helps prioritise remediation efforts effectively.</br>
• Example: The list of critical vulnerabilities includes specific plugin names, descriptions, and solutions, making it clear what actions need to be taken immediately.</br>
</br>
2. Remediation Recommendations:</br>
• The remediation recommendations are actionable and specific, with clear instructions on what needs to be updated or patched.
	This helps the client understand precisely what steps to take next.</br>
• Example: The recommendation to upgrade Adobe Flash Player to version 32.0.0.142 or later to resolve multiple vulnerabilities provides a clear, actionable step for the client.</br>
</br>
<i>Areas for Improvement</i></br>
What two things do you think are unnecessary or could be done more effectively?</br>
</br>
1. Excessive Detail on Low Severity Vulnerabilities:</br>
• The detailed listing of low severity vulnerabilities might be unnecessary and can overwhelm the reader. Low severity issues could be summarised to keep the focus on more critical vulnerabilities.</br>
• Improvement: Provide a summary of low severity vulnerabilities with an option to delve into details if needed, rather than listing each one extensively.</br>
</br>
2. Generic Methodology Description:</br>
• The methodology section is quite generic and does not provide specific insights into how the scan was tailored to the client's unique environment.</br>
• Improvement: Customise the methodology section to reflect the specific nuances of the client's network and environment. Include any unique challenges faced during the scan and how they were addressed.</br>
</br>
<i>Conclusion</i></br>
The PurpleSec vulnerability scan report provides a solid foundation for understanding the security posture of the client's network.
With a few enhancements, it can fully meet the NCSC's requirements for preparing a baseline for penetration testing.
Incorporating historical data, contextual information, and a more tailored methodology will make the report more comprehensive and actionable.</br>

</br>
	<i>Reflection on Next Generation Internet Solutions and Generative AI in Network Security</i></br>
</br>
In this unit, we explored the evolving landscape of the internet, focusing on technological advancements addressing current limitations.
	We reviewed alternative approaches for the next generation of the internet, investigating how these solutions mitigate technical, security, social, legal, and privacy challenges.</br>
</br>
Upon completing this unit, I can:</br>
Describe the operation of alternative next-generation internet solutions.</br>
Explain how these solutions address key challenges.</br>
Engage in debates about the positive and negative aspects of generative AI in network security.</br>
</br>
Generative AI presents significant potential in enhancing network security by automating threat detection and response.
	However, it brings ethical, legal, and social considerations that need critical examination.</br>
</br>
Through this unit, I have developed a nuanced understanding of how generative AI can streamline network security operations while critically evaluating its implications.
	I am now better equipped to navigate the evolving landscape of internet technology and contribute to a more secure digital ecosystem.</br>
</br>
<b>Unit 6 Seminar - The Debate - Generative AI and its Impact on Network Security</b></br>
</br>
<i>Slide Title: Enhancing Network Security with Generative AI</i></br>
</br>
Introduction:</br>
Generative AI offers significant potential to streamline network security operations, automating routine tasks and empowering human resources to focus on complex security challenges and strategic planning.</br>
</br>
Example: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic</br>
</br>
1. Data Collection:</br>
Collects vast amounts of historical network traffic data, including packet headers, flow information, and communication patterns.
Incorporates data from other sources such as server logs, user activity records, and threat intelligence feeds.</br>
	</br>
2. Training the Model:</br>
Utilises machine learning techniques to train a generative model on the collected data to learn normal patterns of network behaviour.
Identifies typical traffic patterns, usual data transfer rates, common protocols, and standard communication pathways within the network.</br>
</br>
3. Anomaly Detection:</br>
Continuously monitors incoming network traffic in real-time.</br>
Flags anomalies as potential security threats when deviations from the learned normal behaviour are detected.</br>
Anomalies could include unusual spikes in data transfer, unexpected access attempts, or communication patterns that differ significantly from the norm.</br>
</br>
4. Alert Generation:</br>
Generates alerts and prioritises them based on the perceived severity of the deviation.</br>
Prioritises alerts related to suspicious activities in critical network segments or attempts to access sensitive data.</br>
</br>
5. Automated Response or Human Intervention:</br>
Triggers automated responses or escalates the alert to human analysts for further investigation, based on the severity of the detected anomaly.</br>
Automated responses may include blocking suspicious IP addresses, quarantining infected devices, or initiating temporary access restrictions.</br>
</br>
6. Feedback Loop:</br>
Continues to learn and adapt to new patterns and threats.</br>
Human analysts provide feedback by validating the alerts and adjusting the model's parameters accordingly.</br>
This iterative process improves the accuracy and effectiveness of the anomaly detection system over time.</br>
</br>
<i>Real-World Application:</i></br>
Application in Financial Institutions:</br>
Major financial institutions deploy anomaly detection systems to protect their networks against cyber threats.</br>
These systems analyse network traffic in real-time, leveraging generative AI algorithms to detect suspicious activities such as data exfiltration attempts, DDoS attacks, or insider threats.</br>
Example: A bank might use generative AI-powered anomaly detection to monitor its network for unusual patterns of data access, login attempts from unfamiliar locations, or abnormal data transfer rates.</br>
</br>
<i>Conclusion:</i></br>
The implementation of generative AI-driven anomaly detection systems represents a significant advancement in network security operations, enabling organisations to enhance their overall security posture,
	reduce response times, and focus human resources on higher-value security tasks.</br>
