	<p><b>Unit 1: History of Network Security, Vulnerabilities and Approaches</b>
		</br>
	<i>Welcome to Week 1.</i>
	This week we will review the history of network security and vulnerabilities and relate it to the modern landscape.
	We will also discuss some security best practices and review the Cyber Kill Chain model proposed by Lockheed Martin (Hutchins et al, 2011),
	which was based on a study of contemporary breach approaches.</br>
	</br>
	<i>In this unit we shall:</i></br>
	</br>
	Review the history of network security and vulnerabilities.</br>
	Discuss a best practice approach to security.</br>
	Review a number of modern scanning and attack approaches.</br>
	</br>
	<i>On completion of this unit you will be able to</i>:</br>
	</br>
	Explain the origins of a number of common attacks.</br>
	Recommend a best practice approach to mitigate attacks.</br>
	Discuss a number of modern protection techniques.</br>

	<b>Reflecting on the literature search and audit conducted on software sites and the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD),
	several issues and challenges were encountered within the https://ginandjuice.shop website.</b></br>
	</br>
	<i>Issues and Challenges:</i></br>
	</br>
	One significant challenge was the vast amount of data available in the NVD.
	Filtering relevant information from an extensive database required careful keyword selection and attention to detail.</br>
	Additionally, keeping track of the continuously updated data posed a challenge, as new vulnerabilities are frequently added.
	The sheer volume of vulnerabilities, especially for widely used platforms like WordPress, necessitated a focused approach to prioritize the most critical ones.</br>
	Another issue was the technical complexity of some vulnerability descriptions.
	Understanding the technical specifics of certain vulnerabilities required a deep understanding of cybersecurity concepts, which can be challenging for those not specialised in this field.</br>
	This complexity sometimes made it difficult to translate technical details into actionable insights for the audit report.</br>
	</br>
	<i>Overcoming Challenges:</i></br>
	</br>
	To overcome these challenges, a systematic approach was adopted.
	Filtering techniques were used to narrow down the search results in the NVD, focusing on vulnerabilities specific to the technologies used by the target website, such as web server software and content management systems.</br>
	Additionally, leveraging summaries and impact metrics provided by the NVD helped in prioritising vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.</br>
	Consulting additional sources such as vendor-specific security advisories and industry reports helped in cross-referencing data and gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the vulnerabilities.</br>
	This multi-source approach ensured that the audit was thorough and well-informed.</br>
	</br>
	<i>Impact on the Final Report</i></br>
	These challenges and the methods used to address them will have a positive impact on the final report.
	The systematic filtering and prioritisation of vulnerabilities will ensure that the report is focused on the most relevant and critical issues.</br>
	The inclusion of cross-referenced data from multiple sources will enhance the credibility and comprehensiveness of the findings.
	Additionally, the process of translating technical details into actionable insights will make the report more accessible to a broader audience, including stakeholders who may not have a technical background.</br>
	</br>
	In summary, despite the challenges faced during the literature search and audit, the strategies employed to overcome them have ensured that the final report will be well-organised, thorough, and actionable.
	This will ultimately contribute to a stronger security posture for the website under review.</br>
