	<b>Summary of Week 1: Security and Risk Management</b>
</br>
In the first week of our course, we explored foundational concepts in Security and Risk Management.</br>
	We reviewed various definitions of these terms, highlighting their importance in protecting assets and mitigating threats.</br>
	Key concepts in security and risk management were examined, emphasising their interrelated nature.</br>
</br>
A significant part of our learning was the Risk Management Process, which involves identifying, assessing, qualifying, and mitigating risks.</br>
	This proactive approach underscored the importance of anticipating threats rather than merely reacting to them.</br>
</br>
By the end of the week, we gained the ability to:</br>
	</br>
•	Discuss different definitions of risk.</br>
•	Assess, qualify, and mitigate risks.</br>
•	Describe methods for quantifying and qualifying risks.</br>
•	Identify and select appropriate security and risk standards for various situations.</br>
This foundational knowledge sets the stage for applying these principles in real-world scenarios,
	highlighting the critical importance of security and risk management in today's digital landscape.</br>

	<b>Unit 2 Seminar</b></br>
<i>Title: Threat Modelling Exercises</i></br>
Read Shostack (2018), chapters 3 – 5, which cover STRIDE and DREAD, Attack Trees and Attack libraries.
	Read Spring et al (2021), which discusses the history and some failings with CVSS.
	Then create a threat model based on one of the following scenarios:</br>
</br>
<b>Threat Model for a Large International Bank Based in the UK</b>
</br>
<i>1. Identify Assets and Security Objectives:</i></br>
Assets:</br>
• Customer data (personal and financial information)</br>
• Bank internal systems (databases, servers, applications)</br>
• Financial transaction systems</br>
• Physical assets (ATMs, data centers)</br>
• Communication networks</br>
</br>
Security Objectives:</br>
• Confidentiality of customer data</br>
• Integrity of financial transactions</br>
• Availability of banking services</br>
• Compliance with regulatory requirements</br>
</br>
<i>2. Identify Threats Using STRIDE:</i></br>

	<p><b>Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management</b></br>
	</br>
	<i>Security standards: Review the following links/ websites and answer the questions below.</i></br>
ICO. (2020) Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</br>
PCI Security Standards.org. (2020) Official PCI Security Standards Council Site - PCI Security Standards Overview.</br>
HIPAA. (2020) HIPAA For Dummies – HIPAA Guide.</br>
	</br>
• Which of the standards discussed in the sources above would apply to the organisation discussed in the assessment?
	For example, a company providing services to anyone living in Europe or a European-based company or public body would most likely be subject to GDPR.
	A company handling online payments would most likely need to meet PCI-DSS standards.</br>
</br>
	1. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):</br>
• Applicability: GDPR applies to any organisation that processes personal data of individuals in the European Union, regardless of the organisation's location.</br>
• Evaluation: To check if GDPR standards are being met, you would typically assess:</br>
o How personal data is collected, stored, and processed.</br>
o Whether data subjects' rights (such as access, rectification, erasure) are respected.</br>
o Existence of mechanisms for data breach notification and handling.</br>
• Recommendations:</br>
o Conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) to identify and mitigate risks.</br>
o Implement data protection policies and procedures.</br>
o Ensure staff are trained on GDPR principles and requirements.</br>
</br>
• Evaluate the company against the appropriate standards and decide how would you check if standards were being met?</br>
	</br>
	2. PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):</br>
• Applicability: PCI-DSS applies to organisations that handle credit card information.</br>
• Evaluation: To check if PCI-DSS standards are being met, you would typically assess:</br>
• How credit card data is processed, stored, and transmitted.</br>
• Compliance with requirements such as encryption, access control, and regular security testing.</br>
• Implementation of policies and procedures to protect cardholder data.</br>
Recommendations:</br>
• Conduct regular PCI-DSS assessments and audits.</br>
• Segment the cardholder data environment from the rest of the network.</br>
• Implement strong access control measures.</br>
</br>
• What would your recommendations be to meet those standards?</br>
	</br>
	3. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):</br>
• Applicability: HIPAA applies to organisations handling protected health information (PHI) in the United States.</br>
• Evaluation: To check if HIPAA standards are being met, you would typically assess:</br>
o How PHI is handled, stored, and transmitted.</br>
o Implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect PHI.</br>
o Compliance with requirements for privacy, security, and breach notification.</br>
• Recommendations:</br>
o Conduct regular risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities.</br>
o Implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with HIPAA requirements.</br>
o Provide training to staff handling PHI on HIPAA regulations.</br>
	</br>
• What assumptions have you made?</br>
	</br>
	Assumptions:
• The organisation's nature and scope of operations have not been detailed,so specific applicability to GDPR, PCI-DSS, or HIPAA cannot be definitively assessed without additional context.</br>
• The organisation may fall under multiple regulatory regimes depending on its activities and the data it handles.</br>
• Compliance requires ongoing efforts including audits, assessments, and continuous improvement of security measures.</br>
</br>
In summary, to determine which standards apply and to assess compliance:</br>
</br>
• Identify the nature of the organisation's activities (e.g., handling personal data, processing payments, dealing with healthcare information).</br>
• Conduct detailed assessments against relevant standards (GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA) to evaluate current practices.</br>
• Recommend actions based on gaps identified during assessments to ensure compliance.</br>
Next Steps: To effectively evaluate compliance:</br>
• Identify the scope: Determine which standards (GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA) are relevant based on the organisation's activities and data handling practices.</br>
• Conduct assessments: Perform detailed audits or assessments against the chosen standards to identify gaps and areas of improvement.</br>
• Implement remediation: Develop and implement an action plan to address identified gaps and ensure compliance.</br>
• Monitor and maintain: Establish procedures for ongoing monitoring, audits, and training to maintain compliance with applicable standards.</br>
</br>
These steps will help ensure that the organisation meets the necessary security standards and protects sensitive data effectively.</br>

	<b>Unit 4 Seminar Activities</b></br>
</br>
</br>
Activity 1: DR Terms and Concepts</br>
Read Alhazmi & Malaiya (2013) and then answer the following questions:</br>
1. What is the difference between Hot Standby, Warm Standby and Cold Standby? Frame your answers in terms of availability, RPO and RTO.</br>
2. Does the technology deployed affect the options available? For example, can you create a high availability, hot standby solution between two on-premise data centres?</br>
Justify and support your answers with appropriate references from academic journals and sources.
	Add you answers to your e-portfolio and be prepared to share them in this week’s seminar.</br>
</br>
Q1. Difference between Hot Standby, Warm Standby, and Cold Standby</br>
	</br>
Hot Standby:</br>
• Availability: High</br>
• RPO (Recovery Point Objective): Near zero</br>
• RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Near zero</br>
• Description: In a hot standby setup, the secondary system runs concurrently with the primary system, constantly mirroring the data and operations.
	This means that if the primary system fails, the secondary system can take over almost immediately with minimal to no data loss.</br>
</br>
Warm Standby:</br>
• Availability: Moderate to High</br>
• RPO (Recovery Point Objective): Low</br>
• RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Short</br>
• Description: In a warm standby setup, the secondary system is kept updated periodically.
	It is not actively running but is in a ready state that can be brought online quickly in case of a primary system failure.
	Some data loss may occur depending on the frequency of updates.</br>
</br>
Cold Standby:</br>
• Availability: Low</br>
• RPO (Recovery Point Objective): High</br>
• RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Long</br>
• Description: In a cold standby setup, the secondary system is off and requires manual intervention to start up and sync with the latest backup.
	This results in a longer downtime and potentially more data loss since the last backup.</br>
</br>
Q2. Effect of Technology on Standby Options</br>
High Availability and Hot Standby between Two On-Premise Data Centres:</br>
• Feasibility:  Yes, it is possible to create a high availability, hot standby solution between two on-premise data centres.
	However, it requires significant investment in infrastructure and robust network connectivity to ensure continuous data replication and minimal latency.</br>
Technology Considerations:
• Data Replication: Technologies like synchronous replication are crucial to ensure that both data centres are in sync.</br>
• Network Infrastructure: A high-speed, low-latency network connection is essential for real-time data replication.</br>
• Failover Mechanisms: Automated failover mechanisms must be in place to switch operations seamlessly in case of a failure.</br>

	Activity 2: DR Solutions Design</br>
Read Opara-Martins et al (2014) and Morrow et al (2021) and answer the following questions:</br>
1. What are some of the main vendor lock-in issues the authors identify? How would you mitigate them?</br>
2. What are some of the security concerns with the modern cloud? How can these be mitigated?</br>
</br>
1. Vendor Lock-in Issues:</br>
  Main Issues:</br>
• Proprietary Technologies: Vendors often use proprietary technologies, making migration difficult.</br>
• Data Transfer Costs: High costs associated with moving data out of a vendor's infrastructure.</br>
• Service Dependencies: Reliance on vendor-specific services and APIs complicates migration.</br>
• Contractual Constraints: Long-term contracts with high exit fees bind customers to a vendor.</br>
   Mitigation Strategies:</br>
• Standardisation: Use standardised technologies and APIs.</br>
• Multi-Cloud Strategy: Implement a strategy using multiple cloud providers.</br>
• Negotiation: Negotiate flexible contract terms.</br>
• Containerisation: Use containers for application portability.</br>
</br>
2. Security Concerns with the Modern Cloud:</br>
   Concerns:</br>
• Data Breaches: Unauthorised access to sensitive data.</br>
• Data Loss: Accidental deletion or corruption of data.</br>
• Insider Threats: Malicious actions by insiders.</br>
• Compliance Issues: Ensuring regulatory compliance.</br>
• Service Denial: DDoS attacks causing service unavailability.</br>
   Mitigation Strategies:</br>
• Encryption: Encrypt data in transit and at rest.</br>
• Access Controls: Implement strict access controls and audits.</br>
• Backup and Recovery: Regularly back up data and have a recovery plan.</br>
• Monitoring and Logging: Continuously monitor and log activities.</br>
• Compliance Management: Ensure cloud services comply with regulations.</br>
• DDoS Protection: Use protection services against DDoS attacks.</br>
