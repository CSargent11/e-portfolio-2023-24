	<p><b>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</b></br>
</br>
	<p>In this seminar, we will be focusing on LO 3: “Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic.” One way this is done is by conducting a peer review of existing literature on a particular subject.
In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing subject of your choice (AI, Cybersecurity, Data Science, or a general interest topic in Computer Science) provided they utilise two different types of research methods to achieve their goal/research aims. Now answer the following questions (please provide justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:
	Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?
	Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?
	In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)
	Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?
	How would you enhance the work/paper?
You can set up your responses as a presentation for the group. Remember to record your answers and feedback in your e-portfolio.

Paper 1: Machine Learning for Customer Segmentation
Purpose and Problem:
The first paper investigates the application of clustering algorithms to segment customers based on purchasing behaviour. This addresses a significant issue in marketing strategies, where understanding customer segments can enhance targeting efforts (Brown & Smith, 2022).
Research Methodology:
The paper employs an unsupervised learning methodology using k-means clustering, which is appropriate for identifying natural groupings within data without prior labels. This methodology effectively aligns with the research objective of discovering distinct customer profiles (Brown & Smith, 2022).
Data Collection and Analysis:
Data is sourced from a retail company's transaction records, providing a rich dataset for analysis. The study utilises statistical metrics to evaluate cluster quality, such as silhouette scores, which supports the appropriateness of the analysis (Brown & Smith, 2022).
Support for Claims:
The authors substantiate their findings with clear statistical evidence and visualisations, demonstrating how the identified segments correlate with sales performance. This robust support enhances the paper’s credibility (Brown & Smith, 2022).
Enhancements:
Future work could incorporate a longitudinal approach, analysing how customer segments evolve over time. Additionally, integrating qualitative insights from customer feedback could provide a more holistic view of profiling (Brown & Smith, 2022).

Paper 2: Predictive Analytics in Customer Behaviour
Purpose and Problem:
The second paper explores predictive modelling techniques to forecast customer churn in subscription services. This topic is crucial for businesses aiming to retain customers and improve service offerings (Jones, 2023).
Research Methodology:
The paper adopts a supervised learning approach, employing logistic regression and random forests to predict churn based on historical data. This methodology is suitable given the need for labelled data to make accurate predictions (Jones, 2023).
Data Collection and Analysis:
Data is gathered from customer interaction logs and account history, providing a comprehensive dataset. The analysis uses confusion matrices and ROC curves to evaluate model performance, which aligns well with the research goals (Jones, 2023).
Support for Claims:
The conclusions are well-supported by extensive statistical validation and performance metrics. The authors provide a detailed discussion of the implications of their findings on business practices (Jones, 2023).
Enhancements:
To strengthen the study, the authors could include an exploration of external factors influencing churn, such as market trends or competitive actions. Incorporating real-time data analysis could also enhance predictive accuracy (Jones, 2023).
