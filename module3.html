	<i>Question 2: Blog Post (also e-portfolio activity)</i></br>
Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.</br>
Five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions related to the topic of cyber security and the human factor:</br>
</br>
The cycle to help with continued improvement.</br>
P-plan </br>
D-do </br>
C-check	</br>
A-act </br>
</br>
These terms highlight the importance of considering the human factor in cyber security, including the role of users, the need for awareness and competence,
	the value of training, and the establishment of responsibilities and accountability within organisations.</br>

Dealing with the human factor in information security is crucial for establishing a robust security posture.</br>
	Here are some key measures and best practices to address the human factor:</br>
</br>
1. Security Awareness Training: Provide regular and comprehensive security awareness training to all employees.
	This should cover topics such as recognising phishing emails, identifying social engineering techniques, practicing strong password management,
	and adhering to security policies and procedures. Training should be engaging, relevant, and tailored to different roles and responsibilities
	within the organisation.</br>
</br>
2. Establish Security Policies and Procedures: Develop and communicate clear security policies and procedures that outline expected behaviours and
	responsibilities related to information security. These policies should cover areas such as acceptable use of technology, handling of sensitive data,
	access controls, incident reporting, and remote work security. Ensure that employees understand and adhere to these policies through regular reinforcement and reminders.</br>
</br>
3. Role-Based Access Controls: Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that employees have access only to the resources and information necessary for their job functions.
	Regularly review and update access privileges based on changes in job roles or responsibilities. This helps minimise the risk of unauthorised access or data leakage.</br>
</br>
4. Incident Response and Reporting: Establish a clear incident response process and encourage employees to promptly report any security incidents, suspicious activities,
	or potential vulnerabilities they come across. Create a culture where reporting security concerns is encouraged and not met with punishment.
	This enables timely response and mitigation of security incidents before they escalate.</br>
</br>
5. Continuous Monitoring and Auditing: Implement systems for monitoring and auditing user activities, network traffic, and access logs to identify any unusual or suspicious behaviour.
	This can help detect and prevent security breaches caused by insiders or external threats that exploit human vulnerabilities.
	Regularly review and analyse monitoring and audit logs to identify potential risks or policy violations.</br>
</br>
6. Employee Engagement and Communication: Foster a culture of security within the organisation by engaging employees in security initiatives and decision-making processes.
	Encourage open communication channels where employees can ask questions, seek guidance, and report security concerns without fear of retribution.
	Regularly communicate security updates, best practices, and success stories to keep security top-of-mind for employees.</br>
</br>
7. Third-Party Management: Extend security considerations to third-party vendors and contractors who have access to your systems or data.
	Implement due diligence processes to assess the security practices of third-party entities and include security requirements in contracts and service level agreements.
	Regularly review and monitor their compliance with security standards.</br>
</br>
By implementing these measures, organisations can effectively address the human factor in information security and minimise the risk of security breaches caused by human error,
	social engineering, or insider threats. It is important to continuously evaluate and update these measures to keep pace with evolving security threats and industry best practices.

<strong>Unit 3: Programming Languages: History, Concepts & Design</strong></br>
</br>
<b>Team discussion:</b>
</br>
	</br>
We had to read chapters 2,6,7,8 of the course text (Pillai, 2017) and Cifuentes & Bierman (2019) and then answer the questions below.
</br>
1. What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</br>
	2.	Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</br>
	3.	Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</br>
</br>
	Within our team we each answered the questions sepeartely, then shared each of our answers in our group chat.</br>
	Once we had all read each others points we discussed similiarties and differences we had in our answers.</br>
	We all agreed, in the end that C is a more secure programming language compared to Python but that fundamentaly
	most security comes down to the programmer and their skills not the software.</br>
	</br>

	<b>Codio labs:</b>
	</br>
	<i>Buffer overflow in C:</i>
	</br>
The error message "*** stack smashing detected ***: \<unknown> terminated" indicates that the program has encountered a stack-based buffer overflow,
	which occurs when more data is written into a buffer than it can hold. This causes the excess data to overwrite adjacent memory locations on the stack,
	potentially leading to program termination or security vulnerabilities. The "Aborted (core dumped)" part of the message indicates that the program was
	forcibly terminated by the operating system, and a core dump file was created for debugging purposes. To fix this issue, the program's code needs to be carefully
	reviewed to identify and address the buffer overflow, ensuring proper handling of buffer sizes and bounds checking to prevent writing beyond allocated memory.
	This will improve the program's stability and security.
	</br>
	</br>
<i>Buffer overflow in Python:</i>
</br>
The error message "Traceback (most recent call last): File 'Overflow.py', line 3, in <module> buffer[i]=7 IndexError: list assignment index out of range"
	indicates that an IndexError occurred in the Python program "Overflow.py".
</br>
The error has occurred on line 3 of the program. The programme is trying to assign a value (7) to an index (i) in a list (buffer) that is out of range.
	The index value provided is greater than or equal to the length of the list.
</br>
To fix the issue, the index that is being uses to access the list falls within its valid range. The index value needs to be less than the length of the list (taking into account zero-based indexing).
</br>
Once pip has been installed here is what happens.
</br>
1. "Building wheels for collected packages: typed-ast": The installation process is building "wheels" (a binary distribution format in Python) for the package named "typed-ast".
	This step is necessary to compile the package for the specific platform.
</br>
2. "Running setup.py bdist_wheel for typed-ast ...done": The setup.py script for the "typed-ast" package is being executed to create the wheel distribution,
	and it was completed successfully.
</br>
3. "Stored in directory: /home/codio/.cache/pip/wheels/a0/57/54/6c037af50d26591734cd3024784a7caab619474ea4a7c22ab4": The resulting wheel file for the "typed-ast"
	package was stored in the specified directory.
</br>
4. "Successfully built typed-ast": The "typed-ast" package was built successfully.
</br>
5. "Installing collected packages": The installation process is now proceeding to install the packages listed after this line.
</br>
6. The subsequent lines list the packages that are being installed. Each line shows the name of the package followed by its version number.
</br>
Based on the provided output, the installation process was successful, and the listed packages have been installed with their respective versions.
</br>

	<strong>Unit 4: Exploring Programming Language Concepts</strong>
</br>
</br>
<i>What is ReDOS and what part do ‘Evil Regex’ play?</i>
</br>
ReDOS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) is a vulnerability that occurs when a particular regular expression pattern is susceptible to exponential backtracking.
	It can lead to significant performance degradation or even denial of service due to the excessive amount of time and resources consumed by the regex engine to process certain inputs.
	ReDOS vulnerabilities can be exploited by crafting input strings that trigger the worst-case scenario for the regex pattern,
	causing the regex engine to spend an excessive amount of time evaluating the input (Larson & Kirk, 2016).
</br>
What are the common problems associated with the use of regex? How can these be mitigated?
</br>
"Evil Regex" refers to regular expressions that are intentionally crafted to exploit ReDOS vulnerabilities.
	These malicious regex patterns are designed to cause excessive backtracking, leading to denial of service or severe performance degradation when processing specific inputs (Larson & Kirk, 2016).
</br>
</br>
<i>How and why could regex be used as part of a security solution?</i>
	</br>
Common problems associated with the use of regex include:
</br>
   a. Exponential Backtracking: Certain regex patterns can exhibit exponential backtracking, causing the regex engine to spend an inordinate amount of time processing input strings.
</br>
   b. Catastrophic Backtracking: This occurs when a regex pattern has multiple valid interpretations for a given input, leading to inefficient matching and performance issues.
</br>
   c. Inadequate Input Validation: Improper use of regex can lead to insufficient input validation, allowing potentially malicious input to bypass security checks.
</br>
   d. Complexity and Maintainability: Complex regex patterns can be challenging to understand, debug, and maintain over time, leading to code readability issues and potential bugs.
</br>
	</br>
<i>To mitigate these problems, the following steps can be taken:</i>
</br>
   a. Optimize Regex Patterns: Analyse and optimise regex patterns to avoid excessive backtracking and catastrophic backtracking.
	This involves structuring patterns to minimise ambiguity and unnecessary complexity.
</br>
   b. Input Length Limitations: Enforce input length limitations and implement proper input validation to prevent long inputs from triggering excessive backtracking.
</br>
   c. Use Regex Engines with Backtracking Limits: Employ regex engines or libraries that provide backtracking
	limits or timeouts to prevent regex evaluation from consuming excessive resources.
</br>
   d. Thorough Testing: Perform comprehensive testing of regex patterns with various input scenarios, including edge cases and long inputs,
	to identify and address potential performance issues.
</br>
	</br>
<i>4. Regex can be used as part of a security solution for various purposes:</i>
</br>
   a. Input Validation and Filtering: Regex can be employed to validate and filter user inputs,
	protecting against common security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) by ensuring that inputs meet expected patterns.
</br>
   b. Log Analysis and Intrusion Detection: Regex can be used to analyse logs and detect patterns indicative of security breaches or intrusion attempts.
	This can aid in identifying and responding to potential security incidents.
</br>
   c. Data Sanitisation: Regex can help sanitize and scrub sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or credit card numbers,
	from data sets to protect privacy and comply with data protection regulations.
</br>
   d. Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules: Regex patterns can be used in web application firewalls to create rules for
	blocking or allowing specific types of requests based on predefined patterns, helping to protect against common web application attacks.
</br>
However, it's important to note that regex should be used judiciously and with caution. Proper validation,
	testing, and understanding of regex patterns are essential to avoid introducing vulnerabilities or performance issues.
