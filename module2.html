	<h2>Object-oriented Programming</br>
		Module 2</h2>
	</br>
	<strong>Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm</strong></br>
	</br>
The object-oriented paradigm involves the development of active program units called objects.
Objects include functions which describe how an object should respond to various stimuli.
The object-oriented approach to a problem is to identify objects involved and describe them as self-contained units.
In turn, object-oriented programming languages provide statements for describing objects and their behaviour (Brookshear & Brylow, 2020).
<br/>
	<br/>
Review codio module classes and objects – As python is an object-oriented programming language, almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. Within these there are different functions to help the programme run smoothly.<br/>
A class describes the contents of the objects that belong to it: it describes an aggregate of data fields called instance variables, and defines the operations called methods.
An object is an element or instance of a class; objects have the behaviours of their class. The object is the actual component of programs, while the class specifies how instances are created and how they behave (Phillips, 2018).
<br/>
Article review/discussion – One aspect that is unexpected…
That there are not more studies, published research relating to E-portfolios. The article stated that the researchers found zero published studies.
How can we utilise E-portfolios to support and foster learning.
E-portfolios can foster learning and show a deeper understanding/learning. It is a continuous reflection of their learning. John Dewey, 1933 said reflection is critical in developing knowledge and people learn best from reflection of their own experiences.
Reflective learning paired with transformative learning helps students better understand the topic they are studying more in depth.
The Hewett foundation, 2013 stated deeper learning to have 6 levels; master core academic content, think critically, solve complex problems, communicate effectively, work collaboratively, and learn how to learn and develop academic mindsets (Di Silvestro & Nadir, 2020).
In conclusion E-Portfolios can help students find greater meaning in their education and develop a better understanding of their learning process which in turn promotes confidence in their abilities within the subject they are studying.

<strong>Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python</strong></br>
</br>
Review codio modules class function and class methods – 
In this lab I learnt a function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function and the function will return data as a result.</br>
However, class methods are defined inside a class and are similar to defining a regular function.
Comparable to inside an instance method, we use the self keyword to access or modify the instance variables.</br>
Same inside the class method, we use the cls keyword as a first parameter to access class variables.
Therefore, the class method gives us control of changing the class state (Phillips, 2018).

<strong>Unit 3: UML</strong>
</br>
	Discussion – which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle:</br>
UML (Unified Modelling Language) is a standardised graphical language used in software engineering to model and document software systems.
It offers a range of diagrams and techniques to represent different aspects of a system.
Throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), various UML models are employed to support different stages of development (Rumbaugh, et al. 2004).</br>
During requirements gathering and analysis, use case diagrams are used to capture system interactions and functional requirements.
In the design phase, class diagrams illustrate the structure of the system, helping to create a robust object-oriented design.</br>
Sequence diagrams showcase dynamic behaviour, aiding in understanding system interactions. Activity diagrams model processes and workflows, supporting requirements, analysis, and design.
State transition diagrams depict complex behaviour and state transitions (Brookshear & Brylow, 2020).</br>
It's important to note that the selection and emphasis on UML models may vary based on a project's requirements and development methodology.</br>
Additionally, in modern SDLC approaches, multiple UML models can be used iteratively throughout the development process.
Overall, UML provides a standardised language that facilitates clear communication and understanding among stakeholders involved in software development (Lange et al., 2006).
</br>
	</br>
<strong>Unit 4: Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice</strong></br>
</br>
Applying UML (Unified Modelling Language) models in software development facilitates the implementation process.
UML provides a standardised notation for visualising and documenting software systems.
Key UML diagrams used in practice include use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams.</br>
By utilising UML diagrams, developers gain a visual representation of the system's structure, behaviour, and interactions, enhancing the implementation process.
UML diagrams also serve as communication tools, fostering collaboration and shared understanding among team members.
It's important to adapt the level and usage of UML based on project needs and complexity, focusing on the most relevant diagrams for a given context (Lange et al., 2006).

<strong>Unit 5: More on Classes</strong></br>
</br>
Review codio module inheritance – </br>
This week I learned the meaning of inheritance and how to use it within python.
	Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
	</br>
	Parent class or base class is the class being inherited from.
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class. It is important to remember when creating a class that inherits the functionality from another class,
	</br>
	to set the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class.

<strong>Unit 6: Abstract Methods and Interfaces</strong>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Review codio encapsulation –
	<br/>
This week in codio I learnt the term encapsulation and how to use it while programming.
	Encapsulation uses the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.<br/>
	This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.
	To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.<br/>
A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.
	The goal of information hiding is to ensure that an object’s state is always valid by controlling access to attributes that are hidden from the outside world.
