<h2>Module 1.</h2>
	<p>Over this 12 week module we will be taught to explore and investigate the fundamental theories and practices of computing,
	then gradually explore the trends and current legislative, regulatory and ethical developments in the field of computer science,
	which are used to minimise computer technology related threats and personal data breaches.<br/>
	These are the aims from this module:
	1. Examine the professional roles, skillsets, ethical responsibilities of computer science professionals.
	2. Examine the relevant computing architectures, practices, applications, data representation and standards in both hardware and software perspectives
	3. Develop an understanding of key computational theories and programming concepts
	5. Develop an increasing confidence in applyting efficient algorithm and programming practices
	6. Develop an ethos of professional development, highlighting major ethical-social-corporate responsibilities underpinning the concepts of threats, securities and global impacts prevailing in recent technilogical innovations.<br/>
	
	<br/>
	Unit 1:	<br/>
	In week 1 I was taught to appreciate the roles and responsibilities of computer professionals.
	Then we had to examine various challenges and threats a computer professional may deal with.
	And Fianlly apply professional ethics and code of conduct in computing practices.
	After our learning we had some tasks to complete, these were to participate in the discussion forum posting your initial post
	and then create an e-portfolio on GitHub to showcase professional development.<br/>
							
							
	<br/>
	Unit 2:<br/>
	In week 2 I was taught to appreciate the evolution of computer and computing technologies due to innovations
	and be able to describe the critical functional issues of computer structure components.
	I also learnt to identify and demonstrate the basic characteristics, functions and features of each element of a computer system
	and demonstrate the theories and nature of data representation for computers.
	Our task this week was to respond to our peers on the discussion forum and conitune building my E-portfolio.
	I also had to prepare for seminar 1 by drawing a schematic diagram of a computer’s CPU and label it.
	Then list the functionality of each component.
	Differentiate and distinguish between different types of computers in terms of their functionality, namely, supercomputer, desktop, laptop, and hand-held device.
	Compare and contrast between a ‘Register’ and a ‘Memory’ cell and provide examples where necessary.
	For this I made a Power Point presentation which I will attach.
	
	<br/>
	
	<br/>
	Unit 3:<br/>
	In week 3 I was taught to appreciate the emerging trend of computing that led to the advancement of human computer interaction.
	Identify the fundamental technologies that are deployed to support the emerging computing technologies and
	identify the risks and threats associated with emerging technology and suggest guidelines to mitigate those risks.
	Our task this week was to participate in the discussion forum with my peers, explore AI tools developed by Google and investigate, review and try it out.
	Then I had to explore Google Translation by entering a sentence and then translating it to a language I understand. After I had to examine the quality of the translation, then analyse the translation quality.
							
	<br/>
								
	<br/>
	Unit 4:<br/>
	In week 4 I was taught to open a website on a browser then investigate various functionalities that are associated with the browser to get a webpage loaded.<br>

	Apply different software development methodology to collaborate, design, develop and test software.
	Identify correct methodology for software validation and correctness.
	<br/>
	
	Our task this week was to identify a system and a piece of software of my choice.
	Then investigate the features of this software and then compare their features.
	<br/>
	
	
	<br/>
	Unit 6:<br/>
	In week 6 I was taught to appreciate the functionality, features and tools of OS
	and identify then select an operating system that is most suitable to accomplish a task.
	<br>
	
	Our task this week was to investigate the features that OS offers by visiting ‘Preferences’ sections of your OS setting.
	Open a new folder.
	Create a file and store the file in the previously created folder.
	Rename the folder that you create.
	Rename the file you created.
	Check the properties of the newly opened folder and the file.
	And finally prepare for seminar 4.
	<br/>
	
	
	<br/>
	Unit 7:<br/>
	In week 7 I was taught to appreciate the importance of the concepts of data structure, their functionality and techniques.
	Apply and demonstrate the applications of data structure in computer programming.
	<br>
	
	Our task this week was to compare and contrast between linear and non-linear data structure, and Stack and Queue.
	Continue with the Python activities in Codio.
	And finally attend semianr 4; Data structures.
	<br/>
	
	
	<br/>
	Unit 8:<br/>
	In week 8 I was taught to apply the algorithm framework for describing and solving a problem.
	Demonstrate a step by step approach to solving a problem using pseudocode.
	Validate the output using different quality assurance matrices.
	<br/>
