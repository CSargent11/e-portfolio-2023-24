	Question 2: Blog Post (also e-portfolio activity)</br>
Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.</br>
Five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions related to the topic of cyber security and the human factor:</br>
</br>
The cycle to help with continued improvement.</br>
P-plan </br>
D-do </br>
C-check	</br>
A-act </br>
</br>
These terms highlight the importance of considering the human factor in cyber security, including the role of users, the need for awareness and competence,
	the value of training, and the establishment of responsibilities and accountability within organisations.</br>

Dealing with the human factor in information security is crucial for establishing a robust security posture.</br>
	Here are some key measures and best practices to address the human factor:</br>
</br>
1. Security Awareness Training: Provide regular and comprehensive security awareness training to all employees.
	This should cover topics such as recognising phishing emails, identifying social engineering techniques, practicing strong password management,
	and adhering to security policies and procedures. Training should be engaging, relevant, and tailored to different roles and responsibilities
	within the organisation.</br>
</br>
2. Establish Security Policies and Procedures: Develop and communicate clear security policies and procedures that outline expected behaviours and
	responsibilities related to information security. These policies should cover areas such as acceptable use of technology, handling of sensitive data,
	access controls, incident reporting, and remote work security. Ensure that employees understand and adhere to these policies through regular reinforcement and reminders.</br>
</br>
3. Role-Based Access Controls: Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that employees have access only to the resources and information necessary for their job functions.
	Regularly review and update access privileges based on changes in job roles or responsibilities. This helps minimise the risk of unauthorised access or data leakage.</br>
</br>
4. Incident Response and Reporting: Establish a clear incident response process and encourage employees to promptly report any security incidents, suspicious activities,
	or potential vulnerabilities they come across. Create a culture where reporting security concerns is encouraged and not met with punishment.
	This enables timely response and mitigation of security incidents before they escalate.</br>
</br>
5. Continuous Monitoring and Auditing: Implement systems for monitoring and auditing user activities, network traffic, and access logs to identify any unusual or suspicious behaviour.
	This can help detect and prevent security breaches caused by insiders or external threats that exploit human vulnerabilities.
	Regularly review and analyse monitoring and audit logs to identify potential risks or policy violations.</br>
</br>
6. Employee Engagement and Communication: Foster a culture of security within the organisation by engaging employees in security initiatives and decision-making processes.
	Encourage open communication channels where employees can ask questions, seek guidance, and report security concerns without fear of retribution.
	Regularly communicate security updates, best practices, and success stories to keep security top-of-mind for employees.</br>
</br>
7. Third-Party Management: Extend security considerations to third-party vendors and contractors who have access to your systems or data.
	Implement due diligence processes to assess the security practices of third-party entities and include security requirements in contracts and service level agreements.
	Regularly review and monitor their compliance with security standards.</br>
</br>
By implementing these measures, organisations can effectively address the human factor in information security and minimise the risk of security breaches caused by human error,
	social engineering, or insider threats. It is important to continuously evaluate and update these measures to keep pace with evolving security threats and industry best practices.

Unit 3: Programming Languages: History, Concepts & Design
</br>
Team discussion:
</br>
	</br>
We had to read chapters 2,6,7,8 of the course text (Pillai, 2017) and Cifuentes & Bierman (2019) and then answer the questions below.
</br>
1. What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</br>
	2.	Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</br>
	3.	Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</br>
</br>
	Within our team we each answered the questions sepeartely, then shared each of our answers in our group chat.</br>
	Once we had all read each others points we discussed similiarties and differences we had in our answers.</br>
	We all agreed, in the end that C is a more secure programming language compared to Python but that fundamentaly
	most security comes down to the programmer and their skills not the software.</br>
